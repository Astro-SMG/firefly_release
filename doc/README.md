# Running Firefly 

Here we provide some examples on how to run Firefly and how to read the fits to one SDSS output. The full documentation of the Python code generated with Sphynx can be found [here](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~comparat/firefly_doc/). 

## Content 

**firefly_output** This notebook shows what is typically stored in a Firefly output file, including the best fit spectra compared to the original.

**one_spectra_firefly** This notebook shows how to run Firefly over one example spectra. This is complementary to the example script: ../bin/SDSS/one_spectra.py.

**run_firefly_hpc.ipynb** This notebooks describes how to use the scripts available in ../bin/SDSS/ to do several Firefly runs in an HPC facility such as [Sciama](http://www.sciama.icg.port.ac.uk/).
